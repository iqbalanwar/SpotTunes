# Design Decisions
<img alt = "database design" src="images/spot-tunes-erd.jpeg" width=500/><br/>
- Our SpotTunes app has three data models: `User`,`Song` and `Playlist`.
- The `User` has the fields id, username and password.
- The `Song` table has the fields id, title and length.
- The `User` and `Song` tables are mapped to each other.
- The `Playlist` JOIN table connects user_id and song_id with a many-to-many relationship. 

- All of your design decisions.
- The reasons behind each decision.
